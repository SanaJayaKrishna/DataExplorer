# 📊 DataExplorer

**DataExplorer** is a powerful and user-friendly **Streamlit web application** designed for exploring, profiling, visualizing, and modeling datasets (CSV/Excel). It is built to help Data Scientists, Analysts, and Machine Learning Engineers quickly understand and work with structured datasets in an interactive and efficient manner.

---

## Live Demo

You can access the live DataExplorer app online at:
[https://dataexplorer-s.streamlit.app/](https://dataexplorer-s.streamlit.app/)

Feel free to try out the features directly on the web without any local setup.

## 🚀 Features

### 📁 Data Upload

* Upload **CSV** or **Excel** files with drag-and-drop or file picker.
* Displays a preview of the dataset (first and last few rows).

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Automated EDA** using `ydata-profiling` to generate a full profiling report.
* Visual summaries including:

  * Missing value analysis
  * Correlation heatmaps
  * Data types & cardinality
  * Distribution plots

### 📈 Custom Visualizations

* Generate plots using **Seaborn** or **Plotly**:

  * Histogram
  * Scatter Plot
  * Box Plot
  * Line Plot
  * Heatmaps
* Dynamic plot configuration with dropdowns to select columns and adjust parameters.

### 🧹 Data Cleaning

* Automatically handle missing values using:

  * Mean imputation (default)
  * (Future: Advanced strategies based on data type)

### 🤖 Machine Learning Models

* Train and evaluate basic ML models:

  * **Logistic Regression**
  * **Decision Tree**
  * **Random Forest**
  * **K-Nearest Neighbors**
* Evaluation metrics:

  * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC

### 📤 Report Export

* Downloadable **PDF** or **Markdown** reports (in future implementation).
* Shareable EDA and model summaries.
